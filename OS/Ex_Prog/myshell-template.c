/********************************************************************************************
This is a template for assignment on writing a custom Shell. 

Students may change the return types and arguments of the functions given in this template,
but do not change the names of these functions.

Though use of any extra functions is not recommended, students may use new functions if they need to, 
but that should not make code unnecessorily complex to read.

Students should keep names of declared variable (and any new functions) self explanatory,
and add proper comments for every logical step.

Students need to be careful while forking a new process (no unnecessory process creations) 
or while inserting the signal handler code (which should be added at the correct places).

Finally, keep your filename as myshell.c, do not change this name (not even myshell.cpp, 
as you dp not need to use any features for this assignment that are supported by C++ but not by C).
